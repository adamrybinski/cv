Dear Harrison,

I hope this message finds you well. I've been following your work on LangChain and LangGraph with great interest, and I wanted to share a project I've been working on that I believe aligns well with LangGraph's capabilities.

I've developed an Attempto Controlled English (ACE) agent using LangGraph. This agent processes natural language, converts it to ACE format, and uses ACE English Parser https://github.com/Attempto/APE for validation. The project leverages LangGraph's state management and conditional edges to create a robust, iterative conversion and validation process.

Key features of the project include:
1. Integration with language models (currently using Gemini)
2. Custom lexicon handling every potential business domain (or general language common language that could improve prompting through converting to Controlled Natural Language)
3. Iterative refinement based on parsing results from Attempto Language Parser and LLM (adds new words and their categories - as in: nouns, verbs, etc..- to the lexicon)
4. Flexible configuration for easy adaptation

Given my background in cognitive science and extensive experience with AI/ML technologies, I'm particularly interested in exploring how this project could be further developed or integrated with LangGraph's ecosystem.

I'd be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this project further and explore any potential opportunities to contribute to the LangGraph team. My experience spans from low-level ML implementations to high-level AI system design, and I'm passionate about creating more interpretable and controllable AI systems.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss this project and potential collaboration opportunities?

Attaching my CV so you can glance if my current tech skills matches anything that would bring value to your project

Best regards,
Adam Rybinski
